# Shape_op
"Shape-op" is a project realized during the month of development of the iOS Academy.
The goal was to create a smartphone game that would allow players to reach a reasonable level of "team building". The application, created in Swift, uses the Multipeer Connectivity to allow nearby devices to connect locally and collaborate to complete the game.
Only thanks to the complete collaboration it is possible to achieve the victory, as each player has to play a decisive role in achieving the final goal.

The project was developed by me, Nicoletta Cuomo, Felice Scala, Giuseppe Gaetano and Fulvio Somma.
